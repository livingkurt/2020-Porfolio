# Kurt LaVacque Portfolio

React Portfolio Ideas

Overall

1. Make it so your mouse clicks add shows to all the different sides of the divs
2. Kind of like if the mouse was a sun
3. Add an about me section
4. Make it mobile responsive
5. Make the background fade in 
6. And make the container component fade in too


Projects Page

1. You could have a carousel type scroll or side buttons where the Name could be at the top
2. Have a smooth transition between each project
