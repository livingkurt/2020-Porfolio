            <p>
                My name is Kurt LaVacque and I am an innovator. I take old ideas and make them work better. I learn, create, and make my world around me into a well-oiled machine constantly improving every day. I live in Austin, TX, I am a web developer by day and CAD designer by night. If I'm not moving forward, then I must be moving backward.
            </p>
